# mirrors

Mirrors is a small in-progress game developed by me, Qwerp-Derp. It's a puzzle game in which you have to light
up all of the tiles in order to pass the level.

## Installation

To install the game, you need to run `./build.sh`, which then prompts you if you want to compile or not. Press "y", and then wait for a while.

If an error pops up when compiling, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/Qwerp-Derp/mirrors/issues).

If you want to compile the code on this GitHub page and try it out, you need to use CrSFML (available [here](https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml)), and follow the instructions there to run and execute the program.

## Development

I'm currently developing this game in my own spare time, so the progress may be a bit slow - but it doesn't really matter.
